How do I simply encrypt a file?

Simple file encryption is probably better done using a tool like GPG.
Still, you may have occasion to want to encrypt a file without having to
build or use a key/certificate structure. All you want to have to remember
is a password. It can nearly be that simple—if you can also remember the
cipher you employed for encryption.

To choose a cipher, consult the enc(1) man page. More simply (and perhaps
more accurately), you can ask openssl for a list in one of two ways.

# see the list under the 'Cipher commands' heading
openssl -h

# or get a long list, one cipher per line
openssl list-cipher-commands

After you choose a cipher, you’ll also have to decide if you want to
base64-encode the data. Doing so will mean the encrypted data can be,
say, pasted into an email message. Otherwise, the output will be a binary
file.

# encrypt file.txt to file.enc using 256-bit AES in CBC mode
openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -salt -in file.txt -out file.enc

# the same, only the output is base64 encoded for, e.g., e-mail
openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -a -salt -in file.txt -out file.enc

To decrypt file.enc you or the file’s recipient will need to remember
the cipher and the passphrase.

# decrypt binary file.enc
openssl enc -d -aes-256-cbc -in file.enc -out file.txt

# decrypt base64-encoded version
openssl enc -d -aes-256-cbc -a -in file.enc -out file.txt
