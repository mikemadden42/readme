The following command invokes shred with its default settings and displays the progress.

shred -v /dev/sdX

The -z option is useful to add a final overwrite with zeros to hide shredding.

shred -vz /dev/sdX

Shred can also be used on a single partition, e.g. to wipe the first partition use shred -v /dev/sdX1.

Alternatively, shred can be instructed to do only one pass, with entropy from e.g. /dev/urandom, and a final overwrite with zeros.

shred --verbose --random-source=/dev/urandom -n1 --zero /dev/sdX

badblocks -wsv /dev/device

Options:

-w: do a destructive write test
-s: show progress
-v: be "verbose" and output bad sectors detected to stdout
Additional options you might consider:

-b number: specify the block size of the hard disk which can significantly improve testing time. (tune2fs -l partition as the root user)
-p number: run through the extensive four pass test number of sequent iterations
-o /path/to/output-file: print bad sectors to output-file instead of stdout
-t test_pattern: Specify a pattern. See below.

Badblocks can be made to repeatedly write a single "random pattern" with the -t random option.

badblocks -wsv -t random /dev/device

####

Zero-fill the disk by writing a zero byte to every addressable location on the disk using the /dev/zero stream.

dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdX bs=4096 status=progress

Or the /dev/urandom stream:

dd if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/sdX bs=4096 status=progress

The process is finished when dd reports No space left on device and returns control back.
