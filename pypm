pypm install requests

This command will download requests and its depdendencies automatically.
Unless the -g option is specified, packages are not installed into the
ActivePython installation directory. Instead, PyPM follows the PEP 370
specification and installs packages by default in ~/.local on Unix and
Mac and %APPDATA%\Python on Windows; and the Python interpreter
automatically picks up the local packages.
